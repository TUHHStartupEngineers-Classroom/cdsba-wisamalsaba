```{r}
# Load necessary libraries
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
library(lmtest)

# Load the dataset
hospital_data <- readRDS('C:/Users/wisam/OneDrive/Desktop/Causal_Data_Science_Data/Data/hospdd.rds')

# 1. Compute mean satisfaction for 'treated' and 'control' hospitals pre- and post-treatment manually

# Define treatment-related thresholds
treatment_month_threshold <- 3.0
treatment_hospital_threshold <- 18

# Convert 'Month' and 'Hospital' columns to numeric
hospital_data$month <- as.numeric(hospital_data$month)
hospital_data$hospital <- as.numeric(hospital_data$hospital)

# Segregate data into 'treated' and 'control' groups
treated_hospitals <- hospital_data %>%
  filter(hospital <= 18 )

control_hospitals <- hospital_data %>%
  filter(hospital > 18 )

# Compute mean difference in satisfaction between treatment and control groups BEFORE treatment
before_control_mean <- control_hospitals %>% 
  filter(month <= treatment_month_threshold) %>%
  summarise(mean_hospital_satisfaction = mean(satis)) %>%
  pull(mean_hospital_satisfaction)

before_treatment_mean  <- treated_hospitals %>% 
  filter(month <= treatment_month_threshold) %>%
  summarise(mean_hospital_satisfaction = mean(satis)) %>%
  pull(mean_hospital_satisfaction)

mean_difference_before <- before_treatment_mean - before_control_mean

# Compute mean difference in satisfaction between treatment and control groups AFTER treatment
after_control_mean <- control_hospitals %>% 
  filter(month > treatment_month_threshold) %>%
  summarise(mean_hospital_satisfaction = mean(satis)) %>%
  pull(mean_hospital_satisfaction)

after_treatment_mean <- treated_hospitals %>% 
  filter(month > treatment_month_threshold) %>%
  summarise(mean_hospital_satisfaction = mean(satis)) %>%
  pull(mean_hospital_satisfaction)

mean_difference_after <- after_treatment_mean - after_control_mean

# Calculate Difference-in-Differences
mean_difference_diff <- mean_difference_after - mean_difference_before

# 2. Use linear regression to estimate effects with fixed effects for groups and time

# Fit linear regression model
linear_model <- lm(satis ~ procedure * as.factor(month) + as.factor(hospital), data = hospital_data)

# Display regression results
summary(linear_model)
